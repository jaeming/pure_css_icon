#Pure CSS icon

You can find this one at <http://codepen.io/jaeming/pen/Cctav>.

I wanted to experiment with drawing shapes in CSS. I know others have done it but I hadn't tried it for myself yet.  So without instructions and only my new-found sense of CSS instincts, I set out on this journey.

The first Icon you'll see here was a very basic iteration. But I decided I didn't want to stop there. I wanted to add some colors and subtle faux-reflections.

This was an encouraging start and I think I'll do more of these when I have the need for them.
